# Figuring Things Out with Jana (Online meetings for Women in STEM)

Since 2020, [Francesca Carlin](https://www.francescacarlin.com/) has been hosting online meetups for Women in STEM free of charge. Since 2021 I have been running a subgroup of these meetups called "Figuring Things Out with Jana".

## What is it about?

There are different challenges that we face in academia and it can often get confusing and complicated. During our Figuring Things Out sessions, we will focus on one troublesome topic in an open and collaborative discussion session. Maybe we will figure things out and maybe we won't, but at least we will talk about it in a safe and supportive environment.
