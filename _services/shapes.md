Start your 3D printing journey by learning to create simple shapes.

<img src="/images/models/sphere.jpg" style="float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 10px; width: 50%" />

For example, learn to create a 3D model of a sphere digitally and then print it out. It's a great way to learn the basics of 3D modeling and 3D printing.
